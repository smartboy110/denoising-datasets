BSD dataset for image denoising benchmarks. It is part of The Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark.
https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/

This benchmark dataset is widely used for measuring image denoising algorithms performance. The directory contains training datasets(BSD400) and testing datasets(BSD68).
BSD68 includes the original .jpg files and noisy with speckle Noise of different levels (noise 15, noise 25 and noise 50).
